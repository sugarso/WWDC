      "details": "Why is it called the Beard Bash?\n\nQuite simple because I have a big beard and it seemed like a fun name.\n\nDo I need a beard to attend?\n\nLOL, no. The party is open to developers in town during WWDC, although space is limited.\n\nWhy do you have a party?\n\nI’ve been doing this party for the last six years as a way to say thanks to developers for all the hard work they do. It’s a night where they don’t have to worry about anything, just having a good time.\n\nWill there be music?\n\nOh yes! We have a band play every year. This will be a concert party with great music!\n\nDo I need a ticket?\n\nYes. Tickets are free, but you will need to RSVP in order to attend the party. The process is very simple—we will make an announcement on how to RSVP as we get closer to WWDC.\n\nCan I bring a friend?\n\nIf your friend registers for a ticket, sure 🙂\n\nWill alcohol be served?\n\nYes, beer (lots of Heineken) and wine will be free. Mixed drinks can be purchased. There will also be non-alcoholic beverages available.\n\nDo I need to be 21 years old to attend?\n\nNo, this is an all ages party. If you would like to drink, you will need to show your ID to get a wrist band.\n\nWhere and when will the party be held?\n\nThe party is being held at the City National Civic Center in San Jose—directly across the street from WWDC. The event will be on \nMonday, June 5, 2017 from 8 pm -12 am.\n\nIs the party sponsored?\n\nYes we have a number of companies that sponsor the party. There are limited sponsorship spots available, but if you are interested please email me directly.",

We needed a space station at least. At the same time, Paddle as an e-commerce and billing giant were pushing for a prestigious and comfortable place. We looked hard and then it hit us: our perfectly comfortable spot that cradles the future was right there, in the glorious Museum of Technology and Innovation in San Jose.\nWe have the whole upper lever with all the exhibits to ourselves. Which means Virtual Reality, Robot and BioDesigns, and the rest of the futuristic tech at your service to explore. There are also going to be quite a few top tech journalists and an amazing developer community.
